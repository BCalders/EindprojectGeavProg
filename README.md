# Project 4-Geavanceerd Programmeren v1.4
## Space Invaders
Game made as a project for the course 4-Geavanceerd Programmeren at the University of Antwerp Faculty of Applied Engineering.

The game is an own interpretation of the well know game "Space Invaders" in which the player is supposed to kill al incoming Alien ships before they reach the bottom of the playing field. The game is won if the player destroys all incoming ships, it is lost when the player gets destroyed after being hit to many times, if the Aliens reach their destination or if the playtime exceeds 100 seconds.
